# Tic Tac Toe in React with Vite and TailwindCSS
What was initially a vanilla javascript project is now going to be a React + Vite + TailwindCSS project. I'm going to use my two previous projects that were split from the original version of this project and they can be found here:
- [Tic Tac Toe Classic](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-ultimate)
- [Tic Tac Toe Ultimate](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-classic)

## Features
- Play classic Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid or play ultimate Tic Tac Toe on a 9 x 3 x 3 grid.
- Play against a friend (locally) or against the computer.
- Playable with mouse or touch enabled devices.
